MongoDB == NO-SQL
No-sql !== SQL
sql = "Structured" Query Language; relational; 

sql = table based;
nosql = documents; 

MongoDB creates schemaless documents which can store any information you want; 
though it may cause problems with data consistency.

MySQL creates a strict schema-template, 
and hence it is bound to make mistakes.
